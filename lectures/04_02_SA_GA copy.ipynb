        "**Simulated Annealing (SA)** is a global optimization metaheuristic first proposed by **Kirkpatrick, Gelatt & Vecchi in 1983**. It is inspired by the  **thermodynamic process of metal annealing**. In metallurgy, annealing involves heating a material to high temperatures and then gradually cooling it to reduce defects in its crystalline structure, ultimately reaching a minimum-energy state. Analogously, SA searches for optimal solutions in complex problems by allowing stochastic \"moves\" that can temporarily accept worse solutions, thus avoiding premature convergence to local minima.\n",

        "  In physical annealing, slow cooling $(T \\to 0)$ allows atoms to stabilize into low-energy configurations.\n",
