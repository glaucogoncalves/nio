# Write your own heuristics

Choose a problem in the [Integer Programming Exercise](ilp-exec-2.ipynb) and choose a strategy presented in the [Heuristics Lecture](../lectures/03_01_Heuristics.ipynb), you must write a python code that implements a solution to this problem following the chosen strategy.

Also solve the problem using ```pyomo``` and the GLPK or COIN-OR solvers.

Please send your Colab file (.ipynb) in SIGAA. The assignment can be done in pairs.

The table below lists each pair of students, the chosen problem, and the chosen strategy.
