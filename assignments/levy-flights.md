# Levy Flights

Code the Mantegna Algorithm (described in the course material and in chapter 3 of the book Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms by Xin-She Yang) to generate the motion of a particle based on Levy Flights.

Starting from position (0,0), the result of the algorithm should display a 2D graph showing the trajectory of the particle's motion. You should just show the final figure, not the intermediary steps. Investigate the impact of the beta parameter on the particle's behavior and relate your observations in your submission.

Your code can be created in Python and must be submitted in SIGAA.
