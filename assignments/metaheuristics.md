# Solve a problem using metaheuristics

Choose a problem in the [Integer Programming Exercise](ilp-exec-2.ipynb) and choose a metaheuristic: SA, GA, PSO, or FPA. You must write a python code that uses the metaheuristic to solve this problem.

Also compare the solution found to one found by ```pyomo``` and the GLPK or COIN-OR solvers.

Please send your Colab file (.ipynb) in SIGAA. The assignment can be done in pairs.
