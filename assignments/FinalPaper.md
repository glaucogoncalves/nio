# Nature-inspired Optimization Course - Final Project

**Goal**

Define, model, classify, and solve an optimization problem (single or multi-objective) applied to engineering.

**Details**

The final project of the discipline consists of the development of a theoretical-practical work. So, when choosing the problem, consider PPGEE's areas of concentration and research lines. The problem definition must be clear and concise and explain the main actual elements involved in the real problem. If you have any doubts about this, talk with the professor on the subject.

The model must show the objective function, the domain of the decision variables and the constraints (if any). Based on the model, the problem must be classified according to the classes of mathematical programming.

For the solution, a classical heuristic or nature-inspired meta-heuristic should be chosen. Describe your solution (algorithm, representation of the population, parameters, etc.) and present results of its application to the problem (convergence graph, Pareto frontier, and so on).

This activity should preferably be done in pairs.

**Delivery**

The delivery will be made in the form of a scientific paper presenting the problem and showing the results of the practical evaluation. The paper must follow the [IEEE Journal Paper Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-journal-paper-template/jbbbdkztwxrd).
