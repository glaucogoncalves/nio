# Nature-Inspired Optimization

Repository of the course Nature Inspired Optimization from the [Electrical Engineering Graduate Program](https://www.ppgee.propesp.ufpa.br/index.php/en/) at [Federal University of Pará](http://www.ufpa.br).

## Course Goal

The goal of this course is to stimulate learning of concepts associated with optimization, specifically for large-scale problems, with a focus on developing modeling and solution skills through classical and nature-inspired strategies for continuous or integer variables, linear and nonlinear functions, single and multi-objective problems with or without restrictions.

The theoretical content and practical demonstrations will be taught through **synchronous face-to-face meetings**. As support, students will also be directed to videos and short texts carefully selected from different sources.

## Grading

Your frequency score will be calculated based on attendance at lectures and completion of activities.

Each student's assessment will be based on a holistic assessment across several activities, including: labs, tests, selected exercises and a final paper.

* Assingments (50%): activities, practical exercises and others.
* Final Paper (50%): a paper to be developed.
